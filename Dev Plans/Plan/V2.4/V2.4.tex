\subsection{Disaster}
Disasters are a new invocation that remains on the Battlefield. They are built to create 
great interference, or slow down your Opponent from having an explosive turn. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Only one can be placed, and is placed facedown. 
    \item Can be casted during any players' turn and on any phase, by turning it phase up. 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Once face up, cannot be used anymore
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
