\newpage
\subsection{Game Mechanics}
\paragraph{Game Mechanics: \\}
\begin{itemize}
    \item When a Summon battles it becomes disabled (turned sideways)
    \item To place a Tier 2 or higher summon, you must demote Tiers total to the Summon's Tier. 
    For example, a Tier 2 may be placed by demoting a Tier 2 or 2 Tier 1s.
    \item At the start of the game, after the turn order is chosen, both players may mulligan any cards in their hand once.
    \item If a cardâ€™s ability were to break one of these rules, the card's ability takes precedence.
    \item When battling, a Player takes DMG equal to the difference between the Summons. 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If a Summon that battles has less DMG than the opposing, no DMG is dealt.
        \item If a Summon that battles has more DMG than the opposing, the Opponent takes the difference, 
        and the Summon is demoted, except if it's Tier 3+. 
    \end{itemize} 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Creation Pile}
Creation Pile is a pile located in the middle between your Deck and Deck Out Pile. It's basic function is that 
cards in it may be added to your hand if they satisfy the Card's Create condition. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Limit: 10 (In Format V1 \& V2)
    \item Abilities that include 'CP' refer to Creation Pile
    \item The goal of Creation Pile is to have a last resort to yourself
    \item CP Cards are identified with CP in the top left along where Tier or Invocation type is located. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Promote}
Promote brings forth two new Tiers, 0 and 4. A Tier 0/4 Summon has a \textbf{limit of 1.}
\paragraph{Tier 0: \\}
Tier 0's are Summons that are placed and have a realm invocation ability, as well as having these attributes: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Tier : 0
    \item DMG: 0
    \item Type: T/S
    \item Promote: Yes
    \item All Tier 0's may not be battled, and treated as a Realm Invocation
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Promote: } To Promote a Tier 0, is to flip it to it's other side where it resides as Tier 4, and 
is placed at the Tier 3 location. To Promote, the player must satisfy a Promote condition that is decribed on the Card. 
If you control a Summons on the Battlefield and choose to Promote, the Summons will be demoted.

\paragraph{Tier 4: \\}
Tier 4's are usually a win condition card and are built to not stay on the field for long. While you 
control a Tier 4 you cannot have any other Summons on the Battlefield. As well as that, they have the 
following attributes: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Tier: 4
    \item DMG: 7/8
    \item Type: T/S
    \item All Tier 4's cannot be demoted in Battle nor be demoted by any Abilities. 
    \item At the end of each End Phase the player takes Damage equal to it's DMG. 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Refusal to pay will result in it being exiled. 
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\newpage
\section{Level Up!}
Level Up! is a new type of Summon with the Tier +, these Summons begin at Tier 1 and goes up to 3, 
having a condition for it to Level Up. To signify this, a die or counter may be used.
\par When a Summon levels up, it is able to only use the ability it's level is at, meaning if it at 
Tier 3, then it may not use it's Tier 2 ability.
\par When a Tier + Summon is demoted, it is actually only brought down to it's previous 
level, and if it is at Tier 1, then it is demoted. This also means, you are able to place Summons equal to
it's level on the Battlefield, then it's level would be decreased to it's previous one. 
\par There is a \textbf{limit of 4} Tier + that can be in a deck for all Formats, and only one can be controlled
on the Battlefield.  

\par Level Up Card Template Coming Soon...
