\subsection{Finn's Fan Fave Shop}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Lulo brings Zane to a Card Shop, Finn's Fan Fave Shop, where Zane can be trained. 
    \item Zane asking the owner, Finn where the owner can be found, is misunderstood as a punk. 
    \item Finn challenges Zane, and Zane blindly accepts. 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Finn (Titans - )
        \end{itemize}
    \item Zane loses, and Finn is told he is there to train from Lulo, so then Zane is accepted 
    into Finn's training program. 
\end{itemize}
