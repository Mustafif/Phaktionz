\subsection{Game Mechanics}
\paragraph{Game Mechanics: \\}
\begin{itemize}
    \item When a Summon battles it becomes disabled (turned sideways)
    \item To place a Tier 2 or higher summon, you must demote Tiers total to the Summon's Tier. 
    For example, a Tier 2 may be placed by demoting a Tier 2 or 2 Tier 1s.
    \item At the start of the game, after the turn order is chosen, both players may mulligan any cards in their hand once.
    \item If a cardâ€™s ability were to break one of these rules, the card's ability takes precedence.
    \item When battling, a Player takes DMG equal to the difference between the Summons. 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If a Summon that battles has less DMG than the opposing, no DMG is dealt.
        \item If a Summon that battles has more DMG than the opposing, the Opponent takes the difference, 
        and the Summon is demoted, except if it's Tier 3+.
