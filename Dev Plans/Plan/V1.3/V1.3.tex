\subsection{Level Up!}
Level Up! is a new type of Summon with the Tier +, these Summons begin at Tier 1 and goes up to 3, 
having a condition for it to Level Up. To signify this, a die or counter may be used.
\par When a Summon levels up, it is able to only use the ability it's level is at, meaning if it at 
Tier 3, then it may not use it's Tier 2 ability.
\par When a Tier + Summon is demoted, it is actually only brought down to it's previous 
level, and if it is at Tier 1, then it is demoted. This also means, you are able to place Summons equal to
it's level on the Battlefield, then it's level would be decreased to it's previous one. 
\par There is a \textbf{limit of 4} Tier + that can be in a deck for all Formats, and only one can be controlled
on the Battlefield.
