\paragraph{How to Win? \\}
The whole point of a game is to win against your opponent, so to first settle the dust, before you even start you must know how to win 
in Phaktionz. In Phaktionz you have the following: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Your deck must contain 50 cards
    \item You must start with 5 cards in your hand
    \item You are only able to play 4 copies of a card unless limits are placed upon it
\end{itemize}
With these requirements, you win by making your opponent's deck reach to 0 by something called DMG. DMG is a short form of saying 
damage, and it is essentially a unit that measures how much cards an opponent removes from the top of their deck. With this in place, 
let's look at the battlefield in which you will face your opponent, (Figure 1).
