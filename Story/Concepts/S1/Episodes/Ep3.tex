\begin{itemize}
    \item Zane is introduced to other members that are also part of Finn's trainings. 
    \item Introduces Khloe and Percy who is in a match and shows off his Mythical Elf Deck, and 
    Reinforcement. 
    \item Khloe eases Zane in with the norms of these trainings, as well as Percy's and Lulo's rivalry.

    the Mythical King is.

            \item Percy (Mythical - Elve's Reinforcement)
            \item Lulo (Mythical - United Army)
        \end{itemize}
    \item Percy loses and admits his defeat, while Lulo stands to not be suprised of the result.
