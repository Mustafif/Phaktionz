\subsection{Lulo's Mystery}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Zane comes to the store suprised to be greeted by Lulo.
	\item He finds out that Lulo works at the shop as Finn's assistant, as well as
	      lives with Finn.
	\item Khloe and Percy decide to tell Zane, Lulo's story since he is part of them,
          but they think it's best to talk at a nearby cafe instead of the shop.
    \item At the cafe, Khloe prepares to tell Zane, Lulo's story as he is her 
    childhood friend, and she has known him for a while. 
    \item Lulo was bullied a lot in school, and Phaktionz was a way they determined the school
    social hierarchy. 
    \item Lulo later got into a dark place when his parents died from an apparent sickness.
    \item Finn finds them talking about it, and decides to talk about how he kept seeing Lulo outside his shop, 
    but never go in. Finn later finding out he was alone, decided to become his guardian as he had lost his daughter 
    recently, knowing how it feels to lose someone. Finn also explains how he sees Lulo sometimes still struggling with it.
        \begin{itemize}
