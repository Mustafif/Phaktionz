While exploring, Zane finds a picture of Finn and two girls. He looks into it, and Finn finds him looking, and says that those were the two loves of his life. He explains wife and daughter died from an unknown random sickness. His daughter went missing and was pronounced dead after three months. 

Finn asks Zane about his father and what happened and why Zane should redeem him. The team huddled up to hear his story. 

Ep 13 - The Prodigy 

Finn sets off the team to explore other shops and see the competition. They visit a shop called Alpha Legends, where they are known to have a strong team. 

When they arrive at the shop, they see someone leave not knowing who it is, and don’t question it. (Later realizing it’s Al Kover, the missing member). 

There they see a match between Brale and Tesa, Brale playing his Oceanics and Tesa his mysterious Probers. They see the end game in which Tesa wins. 

It is announced Tesa, the Phaktionz Progidy won, Zane asks around why he’s called that and meets Tesa. Tesa shows them his Probers Deck, a faction that never recalled in Phaktionz history. The gang gets to meet the team, but they are sadly not participating. 

They tell them that their other member left (They recall that person leaving), and that it’s too late for a new member to qualify for the tourney. Tesa then asks Zane for a battle, just to see how strong he is. 



Ep 14 - Pro Procrastinating
While being busy practicing for the Cities tournament, the gang also is stressed out by the winter final exams. Zane being most stressed out from the ultimatum given to him by his Mom, if he doesn’t do well, he won’t be able to play Phaktionz. 

He asks his smartest friends, Khloe and Tesa, not asking Percy (offended) and Lulo not leaving his room, being busy studying. Khloe, and Tesa set out to help him by mixing problems and Phaktionz together. 

Zane ends up doing really well, but to their surprise he followed Percy’s last minute pro procrastinating advice. 

Ep 15 - The Weird Dream
Zane asleep has another vision looking into the Phaktionz Realm past, he sees a Council room, in which the three origins, and their banners are seated in a round table. The table is a circle, with each origin in the corner, with their letters where they are seated and a Z in the center. During the meeting, King (w. Kleo) and Helios (w. Hulio) are asking of Prestige’s presence, and then are told that he will not be attending. 

They talk about the apparent worm holes, or breaks in the realm that is causing chaos. In which Helios proposes borders that should be set up to deal with the situation temporarily. However each party disagree of the placement of the borders feeling that some of their realm shouldn’t be taken. This causes a huge argument to spur up, which causes problem with how Helios calls King a copycat to his creations and King accuses to the same. 

It ends with, if there’s no borders, war and chaos will break out. King looks and says, “then war it shall be” and they both disappear from the council room.  (At moments during the discussion, King does seem to have sudden headaches and/or rough coughs in which Kleo asks if she is okay.)
Zane wakes up sweating and confused








Episode 16 - The Ultimate Dragon Warrior

Continues off of Episode 15 ending, and starts off with Zane completely shaken from his dream. He realizes at this point it must be something more of a dream, but he really doesn’t know what to do. 

He goes to the shop as the team has only a few days left to prepare. They are all fixing up their deck, and Zane is recommended to play a Tier 3 in his deck. Finn gives him different Warrior Tier 3’s to try out. 

Zane checks them out while he runs to get a few stuff for the gang, he runs into an old man and the cards fall to the ground. The old man with black glasses, a hat, cane and seemingly frail appearance notices he plays Phaktionz. He looks at him, says “You play Phaktionz, I can see you as a pure hearted boy, sorry for this, please accept this gift.” He gives him cards, “Fulthrottle the Ultimate Dragon Warrior”, and says “you look like the right person for this.” Zane picks up the rest of the cards, and stands up to thank him, he notices the man is gone. He sees the card with him, and goes back to the shop. Lulo asks him as he notices Zane fixing his deck, Zane says “yeah, prepared for the very worst”.
