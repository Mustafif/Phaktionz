\subsection{Promote}
Promote brings forth two new Tiers, 0 and 4. A Tier 0/4 Summon has a \textbf{limit of 1.}
\paragraph{Tier 0: \\}
Tier 0's are Summons that are placed and have a realm invocation ability, as well as having these attributes: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Tier : 0
    \item DMG: 0
    \item Type: T/S
    \item Promote: Yes
    \item All Tier 0's may not be battled, and treated as a Realm Invocation
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Promote: } To Promote a Tier 0, is to flip it to it's other side where it resides as Tier 4, and 
is placed at the Tier 3 location. To Promote, the player must satisfy a Promote condition that is decribed on the Card. 
If you control a Summons on the Battlefield and choose to Promote, the Summons will be demoted.

\paragraph{Tier 4: \\}
Tier 4's are usually a win condition card and are built to not stay on the field for long. While you 
control a Tier 4 you cannot have any other Summons on the Battlefield. As well as that, they have the 
following attributes: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Tier: 4
    \item DMG: 7/8
    \item Type: T/S
    \item All Tier 4's cannot be demoted in Battle nor be demoted by any Abilities. 
    \item At the end of each End Phase the player takes Damage equal to it's DMG. 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Refusal to pay will result in it being exiled. 
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
